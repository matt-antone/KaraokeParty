/**
 * A battle is negotiated across two phones and a server, in four round trips,
 * and the only thing either phone uses to decide "am I choosing a song for
 * somebody right now" is getBattlePick. Get that one answer wrong at any step
 * and a phone is stranded: either stuck in a library it cannot leave, or
 * staring at a browse screen while the room waits for it to pick.
 *
 * So this drives the real reducer through the whole negotiation in order and
 * asks getBattlePick at every step — from BOTH devices, since they run the
 * same reducer over the same server payloads and are told apart only by
 * state.user.userId. The invite object in particular is emitted identically to
 * both sockets, which is exactly the trap.
