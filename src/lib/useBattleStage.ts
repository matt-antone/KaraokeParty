/**
 * The battle beat on stage right now, or nothing.
 *
 * Same split as useTriviaStage, for the same reason: the store keeps the last
 * BattleTurn until the next one arrives, which is right for a store and wrong
 * for a screen. A finished 'winner' beat would keep the verdict up over the
 * following song. Expiry is a matter of time passing, so it belongs in a hook,
 * and both the player and the phone draw the same battle, so it lives in one.
 *
 * Unlike trivia, this ticks rather than arming a single timeout for the
 * deadline. Every beat of a battle is either a countdown or a meter filling,
 * so its consumers were going to call useNow anyway — one shared tick here is
 * one fewer clock to drift. The interval collapses to a minute when nothing is
 * on stage: the hook is mounted for the whole night and a 4Hz re-render of an
 * idle player is not free.
 *
 * msLeft is derived from that same tick rather than stored, so there is no
 * setState in an effect and nothing to get stale — the react-compiler and the
 * react-hooks purity rules both being errors on src/**.
