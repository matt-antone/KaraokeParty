/**
 * Listening to the room for one metering beat, and grading it when the beat

 *
 * Every line of this is a hazard, so they are all named where they happen. The
 * two that are not obvious from the code:
 *
 * The analyser is connected to the microphone and to nothing else. It is never
 * joined to audioCtx.destination or to Player's gain node, because the room's
 * microphone is a few feet from the PA the room's music is coming out of, and
 * a graph that reaches the destination is a feedback howl at the exact moment
 * a hundred people are shouting into it.
 *
 * The score always gets reported, including 0. A beat that heard nothing —
 * no permission, no secure context, no microphone, an exception halfway
 * through — grades 0, and 0 against 0 is a draw, which is the honest verdict
 * when nobody was listening. Reporting nothing would leave the server holding
 * a stale grade from the other fighter and calling that a win.
