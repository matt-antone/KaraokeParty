/**
 * Nine beats, walked in order at the times the server would send them.
 *
 * This exists because a battle is the one screen in the app where being wrong
 * is silent. Every beat renders *something* plausible, so a component that
 * shows the challenger's name over the opponent's song, or leaves the last
 * beat's splash up over the next singer, or draws a crowd meter on a player
 * that cannot hear the room, looks fine in isolation and is only wrong in
 * sequence. Driving the real payloads through the real clock correction is the
 * only way to see it.
 *
 * happy-dom because UserImage builds its src from document.baseURI during
 * render. No afterEach(cleanup): nothing is mounted — renderToStaticMarkup
 * returns a string and runs no effects, which is also what keeps the canvas
 * sting and the microphone out of a test that has neither.
