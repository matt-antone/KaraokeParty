 * The queue row the challenger is spending on a battle, or 0 if they have none.
 *
 * Throwing a challenge costs the challenger the turn they already had: the
 * server converts this exact row in place, so the battle keeps the slot in the
 * prevQueueId chain that the row had earned. That is the deal, and it is why
 * this is their *next* turn rather than their last — the fight should happen
 * while both fighters are still in the room.
 *
 * 0 means "I have nothing queued", and the server appends a fresh row at the
 * tail instead. 0 rather than null for the reason every other id on the wire
 * is 0 when absent: no queue row has id 0.
 *
 * Built on getMyUpcoming rather than re-walking the queue, so it inherits the
 * round-robin ordering and the played/paused filtering already worked out
 * there — including, now, battle rows the user is only the opponent in, which
 * fall out below because they are not type 'song'.
