/**
 * A battle's place in the queue.
 *
 * Two singers and two songs, and the whole point of the row is that they are
 * ONE turn: a battle costs the challenger the slot they already had, and the
 * rotation behind it moves up by one, not two. So the two fighters sit inside a
 * single shell with a single header, rather than being two rows that happen to
 * be adjacent — which is exactly what somebody counting the queue would
 * miscount.
 *
 * Not a QueueItem in a costume, for QueueTriviaItem's reason: none of that
 * row's actions have an answer here. There is no one owner to remove it, no
 * single song to star or transpose, and dragging it would move both fighters at
 * once. What it shares with the singers around it is its shell and its edge, so
 * the rotation still reads as one list.
 *
 * The two channels are the crimson and moss the TV uses during the fight, and
 * the same two the library's picking banner wears. They appear as edges rather
 * than as coloured text: both measure under 3:1 as ink on this faceplate, and
 * this row is read across a dark bar.
