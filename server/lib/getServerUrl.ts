/**
 * The address guests reach this server at — what the join QR encodes, and so
 * what any home-screen install is welded to.
 *
 * The fallback is http://<LAN IPv4>:<port><basePath>: the address guests scan,
 * which is not necessarily the one the host is looking at. Undefined when the
 * machine has no external IPv4, in which case the player falls back to its own
 * location.
 *
 * KES_SERVER_URL overrides it because a LAN IP is an address, not an identity.
 * A home-screen install freezes whatever URL it was added from, so an IP that
 * moves with the network — or with a DHCP lease at the same venue — leaves a
 * dead icon, and a standalone window has no address bar to recover through.
 * Point this at a name that follows the server between networks (a Bonjour
 * <host>.local, or a tunnel) and the QR, the install and the icon all agree.
