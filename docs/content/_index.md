## Features

- Plays:
  - MP3+G (MP3 with CDG lyrics; including zipped)
  - MP4 videos
  - Music-synced visualizations (with automatic lyrics background removal)
- Fast, modern mobile browser app designed for "karaoke conditions"
- Easy joining with QR codes and guest accounts
- Multiple simultaneous rooms/queues (optionally password-protected)
- Dynamic queues keep parties fair, fun and no-fuss
- Singers manage their own spot: a **Me** tab with drag-to-reorder, a wait-time readout with a pause key, and a history of what's been sung
- A short intermission between songs that names and shows the next singer
- Fully self-hosted
- No ads or telemetry

Microphones are *not* required since the player itself only outputs music - this allows your audio setup to be as simple or complex as you like. See the <a href='{{< ref "faq.md/#recommended-audio-microphone-setup" >}}'>F.A.Q.</a> for more information.

## Getting Started

 KaraokeParty basically has 3 parts. See <a href='{{< ref "docs/getting-started" >}}'>Getting Started</a> to get up and running step-by-step, or jump to the documentation for each part below:

- **<a href='{{< ref "docs/karaokeparty-server" >}}'>Server:</a>** Runs on pretty much anything to serve the web app and your media files.
- **<a href='{{< ref "docs/karaokeparty-app" >}}'>App:</a>** Fast, modern mobile web app designed for "karaoke conditions".
- **<a href='{{< ref "docs/karaokeparty-app/#player" >}}'>Player:</a>** Just another part of the app, but meant to run fullscreen on the system handling audio/video for a <a href='{{< ref "docs/karaokeparty-app/#rooms-admin-only" >}}'>room</a>.
